# Scaffold-ETH 2 Tech Stack # 
Scaffold-ETH is not a product itself but more of a combination or stack of other great tools. It allows you to quickly build and iterate over your smart contracts and frontends.

Here are the main components:

Hardhat or Foundry (user's choice) for running local networks, deploying and testing smart contracts.
Wagmi for React Hooks to start working with Ethereum.
Viem as low-level interface that provides primitives to interact with Ethereum. The alternative to ethers.js and web3.js.
NextJS for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made hooks.
RainbowKit for adding wallet connection.
DaisyUI for pre-built Tailwind CSS components.
